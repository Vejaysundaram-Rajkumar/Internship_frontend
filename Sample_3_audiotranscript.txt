Over the past two years, youth unemployment has been on the rise. It currently represents just under 40% of all unemployment in Australia. Young graduates leaving university and finding it more and more difficult to enter any form of creative industry.Now the common stipulation is that you can't get a job without experience, but you can't get a job to get the experience.Now meanwhile, 42% of small businesses failed in 2003-2007 and the figures haven't improved much.Amongst many reasons this is happening is a consistent lack of quality in their branding,
marketing, websites and designs.The kind of training that these graduates have just spent 3-6 years training for.Now what if there was an enterprise that bridged these two sets of frightening statistics?I want to build that bridge.
