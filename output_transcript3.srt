1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:28,000
 I'm trying to relax.

2
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
 Would you mind?

3
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:43,000
 Hey, kid, kid, kid, just come over here and sit down, would you?

4
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
 What's your name, mister? My name is Adam.

5
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
 You look like my grandpa, except he's not as old.

6
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
 That's very rude.

7
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
 I'm Adam. Who are you?

8
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
 Joseph.

9
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
 Where's your mother?

10
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
 She's with her boyfriend.

11
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
 I'm supposed to wait over here.

12
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
 I'm eight and three quarters, mister. How old are you?

13
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
 Mister, you're boring.

14
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,000
 Hey, listen, kid, I'd like some peace and quiet. Please?

15
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,000
 You're grumpy, mister. Is that why that woman left you on the bench? Was she your girlfriend?

16
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:43,000
 No. No, she wasn't. Listen, um...

17
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
 I have a girlfriend, mister. And I'm only in the second grade.

18
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
 Where's your girlfriend?

19
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:58,000
 My wife, Elizabeth, is gone.

20
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
 Well, where has she gone to?

21
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,000
 She's gone. Gone. Dead.

22
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:17,000
 Oh, that's sad. Well, my girlfriend, Katie, she's still really young.

23
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:24,000
 Was she a good girlfriend? Katie's the best I've had.

24
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,000
 Yes. Elizabeth was one of a kind.

25
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
 Why? Have you ever had any other girlfriends?

26
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,000
 Yesterday, I brought Katie a flower, and she gave me a kiss on the cheek.

27
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
 Have you ever bought a girl a flower?

28
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:56,000
 You've got a lot to learn about relationships. Have you ever looked into someone's eyes and had a whole conversation in an instant?

29
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,000
 Laughed with someone? Kept laughing until you even forgot why you were laughing?

30
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
 Have you ever cried when...

31
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:14,000
 I cried last night when I said goodbye to Katie. But that was because I had scraped my knee badly.

32
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
 Mister?

33
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
 Yes?

34
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
 Are you going to get a new girlfriend for all those things?

35
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
 Nah. I'm happy just by myself.

36
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
 I think you're grumpy.

37
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,000
 I have lots of girlfriends, mister. Over six.

38
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
 Lizzie was my one and only.

39
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
 You talk about your girlfriend a lot.

40
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
 My wife.

41
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
 I love getting girlfriends, mister. You should try it.

42
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:01,000
 There's not enough time left for me for those kind of shenanigans.

43
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,000
 Plus, I thought I was a boring, grumpy old guy.

44
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
 Nah, you're nice.

45
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
 Well, once you stop breathing.

46
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
 See that pretty girl over there?

47
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:22,000
 I'm about to get a new girlfriend in ten seconds. There's always time.

48
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
 Gotta go, mister. Bye.

49
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
 Bye.

50
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
 Nice day, isn't it?

51
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
 Yeah.

52
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
 It's beautiful.

53
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
 I really enjoy the park.
