1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
 Excuse me.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
 Hi.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:10,000
 I'm trying to relax.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
 I'm going to get you a drink.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
 I'm going to get you a drink.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
 Excuse me.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
 Hi.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
 I'm trying to relax.

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
 What's your mind?

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:38,000
 Oh, sorry.

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
 Hey, kid.

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
 Kid.

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
 Just come over here and sit down.

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
 What's your name?

15
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
 Mr. My name is Adam.

16
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
 You look like my grandpa.

17
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
 He's not as old.

18
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
 That's very rude.

19
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
 I'm Adam. Who are you?

20
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
 Joseph.

21
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
 Where's your mother?

22
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
 She's with her boyfriend.

23
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
 I'm supposed to wait over here.

24
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:20,000
 I'm eight and three quarters, Mr. How old are you?

25
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
 I pray you're boring.

26
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
 Listen, kid.

27
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:32,000
 I'd like some peace and quiet, please.

28
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
 You're grumpy, Mr. Is that why that woman left you on the bench?

29
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
 Was she your girlfriend?

30
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
 No.

31
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
 No, she wasn't.

32
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
 Listen.

33
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,500
 I have a girlfriend, Mr.

34
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:49,379
 in the second grade.

35
00:01:49,379 --> 00:01:53,099
 Where's your girlfriend?

36
00:01:53,099 --> 00:01:57,900
 My wife, Elizabeth, is gone.

37
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:04,219
 Well, where has she gone, too?

38
00:02:04,219 --> 00:02:06,539
 She's gone.

39
00:02:06,539 --> 00:02:09,060
 Gone.

40
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:10,699
 Ted.

41
00:02:10,699 --> 00:02:14,300
 Oh, that's sad.

42
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:19,460
 Well, my girlfriend Katie, she's still really young.

43
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:22,820
 Was she a good girlfriend?

44
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:26,140
 Katie's the best I've had.

45
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:27,980
 Yes.

46
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:30,140
 Elizabeth was one of a kind.

47
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:31,620
 Why?

48
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:33,540
 Have you ever had any other girlfriends?

49
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:39,700
 Yesterday, I brought Katie a flower,

50
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:41,300
 and she gave me a kiss on the cheek.

51
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:46,580
 Have you ever brought a girl a flower?

52
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:51,219
 Kid, you've got a lot to learn about relationships.

53
00:02:51,219 --> 00:02:53,420
 Have you ever looked into someone's eyes

54
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:56,420
 and had a whole conversation in an instant?

55
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:02,420
 Laptured someone, kept laughing until you even

56
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:06,020
 forgot why you were alive?

57
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:07,100
 Have you ever cried when?

58
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:12,140
 I cried last night when I said goodbye to Katie.

59
00:03:12,179 --> 00:03:14,659
 But that was because I had scraped my knees.

60
00:03:18,819 --> 00:03:20,500
 Mr.?

61
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:22,699
 Yes.

62
00:03:22,699 --> 00:03:26,859
 Are you going to get a new girlfriend for all those things?

63
00:03:26,859 --> 00:03:28,500
 No.

64
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,979
 I'm happy just by myself.

65
00:03:30,979 --> 00:03:32,139
 I think you're gumpy.

66
00:03:39,259 --> 00:03:41,739
 I have lots of girlfriends, Mr.

67
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:44,379
 over six.

68
00:03:44,379 --> 00:03:48,260
 Lizzy was my one and only.

69
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:51,260
 You talk about your girlfriend a lot.

70
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:52,820
 My why?

71
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:54,740
 I love getting girlfriends, Mr.

72
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:57,659
 you should try it.

73
00:03:57,659 --> 00:03:59,980
 There's not enough time left for me

74
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:02,260
 for those kind of shenanigans.

75
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:06,700
 Plus, I thought I was a boring grumpy old guy.

76
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:10,740
 Nah, you're nice.

77
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:13,420
 Well, once you stop breathing.

78
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:17,540
 See that pretty girl over there?

79
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:20,980
 I'm about to get a new girlfriend 10 seconds.

80
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:24,420
 There's always time.

81
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:26,300
 Gotta go, Mr. Bye.

82
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:27,300
 Bye.

83
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:42,379
 Nice day, isn't it?

84
00:04:42,379 --> 00:04:43,379
 Yeah.

85
00:04:53,379 --> 00:04:54,860
 That's beautiful.

86
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:56,379
 Really enjoyable park.
