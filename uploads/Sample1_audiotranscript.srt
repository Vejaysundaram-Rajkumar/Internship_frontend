1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
 Excuse me.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
 Hi.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:10,000
 I'm trying to relax.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
 I'm going to get you a drink.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
 I'm going to get you a drink.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
 Excuse me.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
 Hi.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
 I'm trying to relax.

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
 What's your mind?

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:38,000
 Oh, sorry.

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
 Hey, kid.

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
 Kid.

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
 Just come over here and sit down.

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
 What's your name?

15
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
 Mr. My name is Adam.

16
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
 You look like my grandpa.

17
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
 He's not as old.

18
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
 That's very rude.

19
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
 I'm Adam. Who are you?

20
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
 Joseph.

21
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
 Where's your mother?

22
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
 She's with her boyfriend.

23
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
 I'm supposed to wait over here.

24
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:20,000
 I'm eight and three quarters, Mr. How old are you?

25
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:26,000
 I'm going to take care of your boring.

26
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
 Listen, kid.

27
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
 I'd like some peace and quiet.

28
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
 Please?

29
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
 You're a grumpy, Mr. Is that why that woman left you on the bench?

30
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
 Was she your girlfriend?

31
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
 No.

32
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
 No, she wasn't.

33
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
 Listen.

34
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
 I have a girlfriend, Mr.

35
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
 I'm only in this second grade.

36
00:01:49,299 --> 00:01:50,500
 Where's your girlfriend?

37
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
 My wife, Elizabeth,

38
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,000
 is gone.

39
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,400
 Well, where has she gone, too?

40
00:02:04,099 --> 00:02:04,900
 She's gone.

41
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,099
 Gone.

42
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:09,400
 Ted.

43
00:02:10,599 --> 00:02:11,099
 Oh,

44
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,400
 that's sad.

45
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:16,300
 Well, my girlfriend Katie,

46
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:17,300
 she's still really young.

47
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,800
 Was she a good girlfriend?

48
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,599
 Katie's the best I've had.

49
00:02:26,099 --> 00:02:26,599
 Yes.

50
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,599
 Elizabeth was one of a kind.

51
00:02:30,099 --> 00:02:30,599
 Why?

52
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:33,599
 Have you ever had any other girlfriends?

53
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:39,400
 Yesterday, I brought Katie a flower,

54
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,400
 and she gave me a kiss on the cheek.

55
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,400
 Have you ever brought a girl a flower?

56
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,000
 Kid.

57
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:50,099
 You've got a lot to learn about relationships.

58
00:02:51,099 --> 00:02:53,400
 Have you ever looked into someone's eyes

59
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:56,400
 and had a whole conversation in an instant?

60
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,400
 Laptured someone,

61
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,500
 kept laughing until you even forgot why you were laughing?

62
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
 Have you ever cried when?

63
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,900
 I cried last night when I said goodbye to Katie.

64
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:14,400
 Uh, but that was because I had scraped my knees.

65
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:18,900
 Mr.

66
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:19,900
 Hmm.

67
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:20,900
 Yes.

68
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,900
 Are you going to get a new girlfriend for all those things?

69
00:03:26,599 --> 00:03:27,400
 No.

70
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:29,900
 I'm happy just by myself.

71
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,000
 I think you're grumpy.

72
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:33,500
 Haha.

73
00:03:39,199 --> 00:03:41,000
 I have lots of girlfriends, Mr.

74
00:03:41,699 --> 00:03:42,699
 over six.

75
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:45,800
 Lizzy was my one and only.

76
00:03:47,699 --> 00:03:50,599
 Well, you talk about your girlfriend a lot.

77
00:03:51,199 --> 00:03:51,800
 My wife.

78
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,500
 I love getting girlfriends, Mr.

79
00:03:54,699 --> 00:03:55,599
 you should try it.

80
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:56,599
 Yeah.

81
00:03:57,599 --> 00:03:59,599
 There's not enough time left for me

82
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:01,400
 for those kind of shenanigans.

83
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,199
 Plus, I thought I was a boring grumpy old guy.

84
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:08,500
 Nah.

85
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
 Very nice.

86
00:04:10,699 --> 00:04:12,699
 Well, once you stop breathing.

87
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,900
 See that pretty girl over there?

88
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:20,000
 I'm about to get a new girlfriend in ten seconds.

89
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
 There's always time.

90
00:04:24,699 --> 00:04:26,100
 Gotta go, Mr. Bye.

91
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:26,800
 Bye.

92
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:33,500
 Ha.

93
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:35,500
 Ha.

94
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:38,500
 Ha.

95
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,000
 Nice day, isn't it?

96
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:43,500
 Yeah.

97
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:54,500
 That's beautiful.

98
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,500
 Really enjoy the park.
