00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
 If we have a one-minute speech to deliver, the main challenge that we face is how do we really

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
 consolidate so much important information into just one minute? And more importantly,

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
 how do we communicate this in a clear manner? That's where this neat little communication

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
 framework called PREC comes into the picture. This framework will not only help us speak in

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
 a concise manner while making sure all the important points are in place, but the best

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:31,000
 thing about it is that if we have one-minute speeches or short speeches to give in almost

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:37,000
 any occasion, this framework can be applied there. So it also improves our ability to speak on the

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
 spot even when we're not prepared. So what does this framework stand for? PREC. It's

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,000
 an abbreviation which stands for point, reason, example, point. We basically start off with the

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000
 main point or message of our speech. Then we move on to giving a reason for that main point.

11
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:59,000
 Then we give an example and finally end it again with our main point. Let's look at an example.

12
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,000
 Let's say we have to give a simple speech around our favorite genre of music. Now,

13
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
 one of two things can happen. Either we can look at it in a way that there's so much

14
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,000
 to speak about under the topic of music, but on the other end, we might also think,

15
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
 how do I speak beyond just my normal answer? For instance, if our favorite type of music

16
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:24,000
 is jazz, what do we say beyond? Hi, my favorite genre of music is jazz. For both of these instances,

17
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,000
 PREC can be very, very useful. Let's get into the example. My favorite type of music

18
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
 is rock and roll. The reason I like rock and roll music is because I've been listening to

19
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,000
 it ever since I was a little kid. And I absolutely love the heavy guitar and the drum

20
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:44,000
 rolls and the lyrics of rock songs. But more than any of this, I remember attending my first

21
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:50,000
 ever rock concert. That atmosphere was electrifying and I remember it to this day.

22
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
 It immediately made me fall in love with the genre. My favorite rock band is this one group

23
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,000
 called Linkin Park. They were one of the first bands that I listened to and I love everything

24
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:05,000
 about them from their melodies to their rhythms to their lyrics. Unfortunately, I never got to

25
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:10,000
 see them perform live, but I still listen to their music every day. And that is why rock

26
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,000
 and roll is my favorite type of music. And that's basically it. This framework can be

27
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,000
 applied to almost any question or any short speech that we need to give. And if you want

28
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:24,000
 to know more such frameworks that you can apply to short speeches, we've made an entire video

29
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,000
 on delivering memorable one-minute speeches, which has a lot more than just frameworks.

30
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
 And I highly recommend you check that out right here.
