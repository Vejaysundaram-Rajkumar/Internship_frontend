1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,600
 If we have a one minute speech to deliver, the main challenge that we face is how do we really

2
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:11,200
 consolidate so much important information in just one minute. And more importantly, how do we

3
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:16,960
 communicate this in a clear manner? That's where this new clicky communication thing work called

4
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:21,839
 prep comes with the picture. This framework will not only help us speak in a concise manner,

5
00:00:21,839 --> 00:00:27,600
 while making sure all the important points are in place. But the best thing about it is that if we

6
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:33,600
 have one minute speeches or short speeches to give in almost any occasion, this framework can

7
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:39,280
 be applied there. So it also improves our ability to speak on the spot even when we're not prepared.

8
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:45,600
 So what does this framework stand for? Prep. It's an abbreviation with stands for point, reason,

9
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:51,280
 example point. We basically start off with the main point or message of our speech. Then we move

10
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:57,200
 on to giving a reason for that main point. Then we give an example and finally end it again with our

11
00:00:57,679 --> 00:01:02,160
 point. Let's look at an example. Let's say we have to give a simple speech around our favorite

12
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:07,280
 genre of music. Now one of two things can happen. Either we can look at it in a way that there's

13
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:12,079
 so much to speak about under the topic of music. But on the other end, we might also think,

14
00:01:12,079 --> 00:01:17,520
 how do I speak beyond just my normal answer? For instance, if our favorite type of music is jazz,

15
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:24,800
 what do we say beyond? Hi, my favorite genre of music is jazz. For both of these instances,

16
00:01:24,879 --> 00:01:30,399
 prep can be very, very useful. Let's get into the example. My favorite type of music is rock and roll.

17
00:01:30,399 --> 00:01:34,560
 The reason I like rock and roll music is because I've been listening to it ever since I was a little

18
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:40,399
 kid. Am I absolutely looking after heavy guitar and the drum rolls and the lyrics of rock songs?

19
00:01:40,399 --> 00:01:47,840
 But more than any of this, I remember attending my first ever rock concert. That atmosphere was

20
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:52,719
 electrifying and I remember it to this day. It immediately made me fall in love with the genre.

21
00:01:52,719 --> 00:01:57,359
 My favorite rock band is this one group called Lincoln Park. They were one of the first bands

22
00:01:57,359 --> 00:02:03,120
 that I listened to and I love everything about them. From their melodies to their rhythms to their

23
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:08,639
 lyrics. Unfortunately, I never got to see them perform live, but I still listen to their music

24
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:14,319
 every day. And that is why rock and roll is my favorite type of music. And that's basically

25
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:18,560
 this framework can be applied to almost any question or any short speech that you need to give.

26
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:22,640
 And if you want to know more such frameworks that you can apply to short speeches,

27
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:28,080
 be made an entire video on delivering memorable one in the speeches, which has a lot more

28
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:32,560
 than just frameworks. And I highly recommend you check that out right here.
