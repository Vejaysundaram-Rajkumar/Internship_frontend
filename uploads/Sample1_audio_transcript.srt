1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:24,000
 Excuse me.

2
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
 Hi.

3
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
 I'm trying to relax.

4
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:30,000
 Would you mind?

5
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
 Oh, sorry, mister.

6
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
 Hey, kid.

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
 Kid, kid.

8
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
 Just come over here and sit down, would you?

9
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
 Okay.

10
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
 What's your name, mister?

11
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
 My name is Adam.

12
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
 You look like my grandpa, except he's not as old.

13
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
 That's very rude.

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
 I'm Adam. Who are you?

15
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
 Joseph.

16
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
 Where's your mother?

17
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
 She's with her boyfriend.

18
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
 I'm supposed to wait over here.

19
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
 I'm eight and three quarters, mister.

20
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
 How old are you?

21
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
 Mister, you're boring.

22
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:20,000
 Hey.

23
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
 Listen, kid.

24
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
 I'd like some peace and quiet.

25
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:29,000
 Please?

26
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
 You're grumpy, mister.

27
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
 Is that why that woman left you on the bench?

28
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
 Was she your girlfriend?

29
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
 No. No, she wasn't.

30
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
 Listen, um.

31
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
 I have a girlfriend, mister.

32
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
 And I'm only in the second grade.

33
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
 Where's your girlfriend?

34
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
 My wife, Elizabeth, is gone.

35
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
 Well, where has she gone to?

36
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
 She's gone.

37
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
 Gone?

38
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
 Dead.

39
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
 Oh.

40
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
 That's sad.

41
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
 Well, my girlfriend, Katie.

42
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
 She's still really young.

43
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
 Was she a good girlfriend?

44
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
 Katie's the best I've had.

45
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
 Yes.

46
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
 Elizabeth was one of a kind.

47
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
 Why?

48
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:37,000
 Have you ever had any other girlfriends?

49
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
 Yesterday, I brought Katie a flower.

50
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:45,000
 And she gave me a kiss on the cheek.

51
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
 Have you ever brought a girl a flower?

52
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
 Hey, kid.

53
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
 You've got a lot to learn about relationships.

54
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:59,000
 Have you ever looked into someone's eyes and had a whole conversation in an instant?

55
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
 Laughed with someone?

56
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:06,000
 Kept laughing until you even forgot why you were laughing?

57
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
 Have you ever cried when...

58
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
 I cried last night when I said goodbye to Katie.

59
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,000
 But that was because I had scraped my knee badly.

60
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
 Mister?

61
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
 Yes?

62
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,000
 Are you going to get a new girlfriend for all those things?

63
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
 No.

64
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
 I'm happy just by myself.

65
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
 I think you're grumpy.

66
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
 I have lots of girlfriends, Mister.

67
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
 Over six.

68
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
 Lizzie was my one and only.

69
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
 Ugh.

70
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
 You talk about your girlfriend a lot.

71
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
 My what?

72
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
 I love getting girlfriends, Mister.

73
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
 You should try it.

74
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
 Uh.

75
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:02,000
 There's not enough time left for me for those kind of shenanigans.

76
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:07,000
 Plus, I thought I was a boring, grumpy, old guy.

77
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
 Nah.

78
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
 You're nice.

79
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
 Well, once you stop reading.

80
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,000
 See that pretty girl over there?

81
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,000
 I'm about to get a new girlfriend in ten seconds.

82
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
 There's always time.

83
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
 Gotta go, Mister.

84
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
 Bye.

85
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
 Bye.

86
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
 Nice day, isn't it?

87
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
 Yeah.

88
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
 It's beautiful.

89
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
 I really enjoy the park.
