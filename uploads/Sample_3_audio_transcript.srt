00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
 Over the past two years, youth unemployment has been on the rise.

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
 It currently represents just under 40% of all unemployment in Australia.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
 Young graduates are leaving university

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
 and finding it more and more difficult to enter any form of creative industry.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
 Now, the common stipulation is that

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
 you can't get a job without experience,

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
 but you can't get a job to get the experience.

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:40,000
 Now, meanwhile, 42% of small businesses failed in 2003 to 2007,

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
 and the figures haven't improved much.

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
 Amongst many reasons this is happening

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
 is a consistent lack of quality in their branding, marketing, websites and designs.

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:57,000
 The kind of training that these graduates have just spent three to six years training for.

14
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
 Now, what if there was

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
 an enterprise that bridged these two sets of frightening statistics?

16
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
 I want to build that bridge.
