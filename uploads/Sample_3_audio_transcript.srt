1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,000
 Over the past two years, youth unemployment has been on the rise.

2
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
 It currently represents just under 40% of all unemployment in Australia.

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
 Young graduates leaving university and finding it more and more difficult to enter any form

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
 of creative industry.

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
 Now the common stipulation is that you can't get a job without experience, but you can't

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
 get a job to get the experience.

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:41,000
 Now meanwhile, 42% of small businesses failed in 2003-2007 and the figures haven't improved

8
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
 much.

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,000
 Amongst many reasons this is happening is a consistent lack of quality in their branding,

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
 marketing, websites and designs.

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:57,000
 The kind of training that these graduates have just spent 3-6 years training for.

12
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:03,000
 Now what if there was an enterprise that bridged these two sets of frightening statistics?

13
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
 I want to build that bridge.
