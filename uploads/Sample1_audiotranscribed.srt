1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
 Excuse me.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
 Hi.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:10,000
 I'm trying to relax.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
 I'm going to get you a drink.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
 I'm going to get you a drink.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
 Excuse me.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
 Hi.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
 I'm trying to relax.

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
 What's your mind?

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:38,000
 Oh, sorry.

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
 Hey, kid.

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
 Kid.

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
 Just come over here and sit down.

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
 What's your name?

15
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
 Mr. My name is Adam.

16
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
 You look like my grandpa.

17
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
 He's not as old.

18
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
 That's very rude.

19
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
 I'm Adam. Who are you?

20
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
 Joseph.

21
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
 Where's your mother?

22
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
 She's with her boyfriend.

23
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
 I'm supposed to wait over here.

24
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:20,000
 I'm eight and three quarters, Mr. How old are you?

25
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:26,000
 You're born.

26
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
 Listen, kid.

27
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
 I'd like some peace and quiet.

28
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
 Please.

29
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
 You're grumpy, Mr. Is that why that woman left you on the bench?

30
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
 Was she your girlfriend?

31
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
 No.

32
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
 No, she wasn't.

33
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
 Listen.

34
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
 I have a girlfriend, Mr.

35
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
 I'm only in this second grade.

36
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
 Where's your girlfriend?

37
00:01:52,000 --> 00:02:00,000
 My wife, Elizabeth, is gone.

38
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
 Well, where has she gone, too?

39
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
 She's gone.

40
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
 Gone.

41
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
 Ted.

42
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
 Oh, that's sad.

43
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
 Well, my girlfriend Katie, she's still really young.

44
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
 Was she a good girlfriend?

45
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
 Katie's the best I've had.

46
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
 Yes. Elizabeth was one of a kind.

47
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:36,000
 Why? Have you ever had any other girlfriends?

48
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:42,000
 Yesterday, I brought Katie a flower, and she gave me a kiss on the cheek.

49
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,000
 Have you ever brought a girl a flower?

50
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
 Kid, you've got a lot to learn about relationships.

51
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:58,000
 Have you ever looked into someone's eyes and had a whole conversation in an instant?

52
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:04,000
 Left with someone, kept laughing until you even forgot why you were laughing?

53
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
 Have you ever cried when...

54
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,000
 I cried last night when I said goodbye to Katie.

55
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:18,000
 But that was because I had scraped my knee badly.

56
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
 Mr.

57
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
 Yes.

58
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,000
 Are you going to get a new girlfriend for all those things?

59
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
 No.

60
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
 I'm happy just by myself.

61
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,000
 I think you're grumpy.

62
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:44,000
 I have lots of girlfriends, Mr. Over six.

63
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
 Lizzy was my one and only.

64
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000
 You talk about your girlfriend a lot.

65
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
 Why?

66
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,000
 I love getting girlfriends, Mr. You should try it.

67
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,000
 There's not enough time left for me for those kind of shenanigans.

68
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:08,000
 Plus, I thought I was a boring grumpy old guy.

69
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
 Nah, very nice.

70
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
 Well, once you stop breathing.

71
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
 See that pretty girl over there?

72
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,000
 I'm about to get a new girlfriend in ten seconds.

73
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
 There's always time.

74
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
 Gotta go, Mr. Bye.

75
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
 Bye.

76
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:42,000
 Nice day, isn't it?

77
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
 Yeah.

78
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:54,000
 That's beautiful.

79
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
 Really enjoyable park.
