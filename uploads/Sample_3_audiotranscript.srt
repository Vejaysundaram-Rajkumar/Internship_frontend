 Over the past two years, youth unemployment has been on the rise. It currently represents

2
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:21,760
 just under 40% of all unemployment in Australia. Young graduates leaving the university and

3
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:27,120
 finding it more and more difficult to enter any form of creative industry. Now, the common

4
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:32,320
 stipulation is that you can't get a job without experience, but you can't get a job to get

5
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:40,480
 the experience. Now, meanwhile, 42% of small businesses failed in 2003 to 2007, and the

6
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:46,400
 figures haven't improved much. Amongst many reasons this is happening is a consistent

7
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:52,799
 lack of quality in their branding, marketing, websites and designs. The kind of training

8
00:00:52,799 --> 00:00:58,479
 that these graduates have just spent three to six years training for. Now, what if there was an

9
00:00:58,479 --> 00:01:07,439
 enterprise that breached these two sets of frightening statistics? I want to build that bridge.
