1
0.000 --> 28.360
 I'm trying to relax.

2
29.360 --> 31.360
 Would you mind?

3
37.360 --> 43.360
 Hey, kid, kid, kid, just come over here and sit down, would you?

4
51.360 --> 53.360
 What's your name, mister? My name is Adam.

5
54.360 --> 57.360
 You look like my grandpa, except he's not as old.

6
58.360 --> 59.360
 That's very rude.

7
60.360 --> 61.360
 I'm Adam. Who are you?

8
64.360 --> 65.360
 Joseph.

9
66.360 --> 67.360
 Where's your mother?

10
68.360 --> 69.360
 She's with her boyfriend.

11
70.360 --> 72.360
 I'm supposed to wait over here.

12
74.360 --> 77.360
 I'm eight and three quarters, mister. How old are you?

13
79.360 --> 80.360
 Mister, you're boring.

14
84.360 --> 89.360
 Hey, listen, kid, I'd like some peace and quiet. Please?

15
90.360 --> 96.360
 You're grumpy, mister. Is that why that woman left you on the bench? Was she your girlfriend?

16
97.360 --> 103.360
 No. No, she wasn't. Listen, um...

17
104.360 --> 107.360
 I have a girlfriend, mister. And I'm only in the second grade.

18
108.360 --> 110.360
 Where's your girlfriend?

19
110.360 --> 118.360
 My wife, Elizabeth, is gone.

20
119.360 --> 123.360
 Well, where has she gone to?

21
124.360 --> 129.360
 She's gone. Gone. Dead.

22
130.360 --> 137.360
 Oh, that's sad. Well, my girlfriend, Katie, she's still really young.

23
138.360 --> 144.360
 Was she a good girlfriend? Katie's the best I've had.

24
145.360 --> 149.360
 Yes. Elizabeth was one of a kind.

25
150.360 --> 153.360
 Why? Have you ever had any other girlfriends?

26
156.360 --> 161.360
 Yesterday, I brought Katie a flower, and she gave me a kiss on the cheek.

27
164.360 --> 166.360
 Have you ever bought a girl a flower?

28
167.360 --> 176.360
 You've got a lot to learn about relationships. Have you ever looked into someone's eyes and had a whole conversation in an instant?

29
178.360 --> 183.360
 Laughed with someone? Kept laughing until you even forgot why you were laughing?

30
185.360 --> 186.360
 Have you ever cried when...

31
187.360 --> 194.360
 I cried last night when I said goodbye to Katie. But that was because I had scraped my knee badly.

32
198.360 --> 199.360
 Mister?

33
200.360 --> 201.360
 Yes?

34
202.360 --> 205.360
 Are you going to get a new girlfriend for all those things?

35
206.360 --> 209.360
 Nah. I'm happy just by myself.

36
210.360 --> 212.360
 I think you're grumpy.

37
218.360 --> 222.360
 I have lots of girlfriends, mister. Over six.

38
223.360 --> 225.360
 Lizzie was my one and only.

39
227.360 --> 230.360
 You talk about your girlfriend a lot.

40
231.360 --> 232.360
 My wife.

41
233.360 --> 235.360
 I love getting girlfriends, mister. You should try it.

42
236.360 --> 241.360
 There's not enough time left for me for those kind of shenanigans.

43
242.360 --> 246.360
 Plus, I thought I was a boring, grumpy old guy.

44
247.360 --> 249.360
 Nah, you're nice.

45
250.360 --> 252.360
 Well, once you stop breathing.

46
253.360 --> 255.360
 See that pretty girl over there?

47
257.360 --> 262.360
 I'm about to get a new girlfriend in ten seconds. There's always time.

48
264.360 --> 265.360
 Gotta go, mister. Bye.

49
266.360 --> 267.360
 Bye.

50
280.360 --> 281.360
 Nice day, isn't it?

51
282.360 --> 283.360
 Yeah.

52
287.360 --> 288.360
 It's beautiful.

53
289.360 --> 291.360
 I really enjoy the park.
